## Objectives
This working group will focus on AI methods for curation and inference of clinical interpretations of cancer variants from the literature, and practices for evaluating robustness and confidence of predictions for use in variant interpretation. Ultimately, this focus should lead to guidelines, standards, and QC for evaluating the robustness of in silico curation of biomedical literature to aid clinical interpretation.
