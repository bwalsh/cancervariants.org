Precision medicine promises a future in which a cancer patientâ€™s treatment is tailored to the specific molecular alterations of their tumor. Many groups are curating interpretations for which mutations are clinically relevant but their efforts are siloed, often redundant, and not interoperable. Therefore, there is a clear need to standardize and coordinate clinical-genomics curation efforts, and create a public community resource able to query the aggregated information. To address this challenge, we have formed the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) to promote global integration of knowledgebases for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Together, this consortium will create a federated query service able to interrogate associations between cancer gene alterations and clinical actions, for each cancer disease setting, based on evidence amassed from all participating institutions world-wide. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims. There are two ongoing projects related to these aims: [Pilot Knowledgebase Integration](/projects/knowledgebase_integration/) and [Virtual Tumor Board](/projects/virtual_tumor_board/). Progress on these efforts is discussed on the bi-weekly [VICC calls](/join/).

### Specific aims of the VICC

Aim 1. Harmonize global efforts for clinical interpretation of cancer variants and precision medicine clinical trial curation.  We will form an open consortium of developers and curators committed to eliminating the interpretation bottlenecks for precision medicine in cancer. 

Aim 2.  Implement software systems to query across standardized knowledgebases. Given a clinical sequencing assay result, for a patient with a specific cancer type, we will produce a comprehensive report of clinically relevant associations between genomic alterations and diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options using all publicly available sources of expert-curated interpretations.

### VICC Research Scope

The VICC research scope encompasses several related areas of research in support of its mission to deliver actionable consensus clinical interpretations, in collaboration with expert groups of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)) and Clinical Genome Resource ([ClinGen](https://www.clinicalgenome.org/)). This scope is outlined below:
