### Join the discussion
The VICC holds bi-weekly calls of all participants. These meetings serve several purposes:
- Update presentations from the VICC working groups.
- Presentations from existing cancer knowledgebases. These presentations help to increase awareness of otherwise siloed 
 efforts. Each presentation is followed by discussion of developing standards, ontologies, and APIs.
- Input from industry partners and other interested parties.
- Discussion of [ongoing VICC projects](/projects/).
- Planning for grant submissions to support the work of VICC.

Everyone is welcome to join these calls. If you would like to join, please:

1. Apply for membership to the VICC All Member [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicc-all).
2. Join our calls, every other Tuesday from 10-11 AM CT. [Add our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=aG9xYmVrZWY0ODJpODJxY2hvZDM0aWNmbGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for details of these and 
other VICC calls.
