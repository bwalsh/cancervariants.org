### Join the discussion
The VICC holds bi-weekly calls of all participants. These meetings serve several purposes:
- Presentations from existing cancer knowledgebases. These presentations help to increase awareness of otherwise siloed efforts. Each presentation is followed by discussion of developing standards, ontologies, and APIs.
- Input from industry partners and other interested parties.
- Discussion of [ongoing VICC projects](/projects/).
- Planning for grant submissions to support the work of VICC.

Everyone is welcome to join these calls. If you would like to join, please:

1) Fill out the [research interests and availability survey](https://forms.gle/Fizjbr4cscfySHec6).
2) Apply for membership to the VICC All Member [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vicc-all)
3) Join our biweekly calls! (Most recently March 26, 2019, with rescheduling under evaluation)

### Adopt the VICC sharing principles
If your organization is currently creating a knowledgebase of clinical interpretations of cancer variants, please considering formally joining the VICC by adopting the [VICC Guiding Principles](/principles/) and signing the [Letter of Support](/resources/).
