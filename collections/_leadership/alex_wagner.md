Dr. Wagner is an Instructor at Washington University School of Medicine, where he leads the development of tools and standards for advancing precision medicine and our knowledge of genomic alterations in cancers. Dr. Wagner formally accepted the role of VICC co-director in Fall 2018, and a subsequent appointment as co-leader of the Variant Representation group of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (ga4gh.org) in March 2019. 

In his postdoctoral work at Washington University, Dr. Wagner co-developed several precision medicine web tools, including the popular Drug-Gene Interaction Database (www.dgidb.org), the database of Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC; www.civicdb.org), and the VICC meta-knowledgebase (search.cancervariants.org). He is also a lead developer of the GA4GH Variation Representation specification, a computational framework for precisely representing and sharing variation across systems (vr-spec.readthedocs.io).

In collaboration with his colleagues at the Siteman Cancer Center, Dr. Wagner also led the integrative analysis of tumor sequencing data from a relapsed small cell lung cancer cohort.  His work demonstrated WNT signaling activation as a recurrent mechanism of acquired chemoresistance in this aggressive tumor type.

Dr. Wagner plans to extend his expertise in medical informatics and cancer genomics into an independent research program. He is a champion for open science and the free exchange of biomedical knowledge.
