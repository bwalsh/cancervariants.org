Beth Pitel works as a Development technologist II in the Genomics Laboratory at Mayo Clinic and has helped develop clinical genetic testing using several different testing modalities including NGS oncology panels, RNAseq, Mate Pair sequencing, chromosomal microarray, and qPCR.  Beth is the lead development technologist on the Genomics of Oncology Annotation Team (GOAT) at Mayo Clinic, which creates interpretive resources for the laboratory based on current knowledgebase content, database content, commercial oncology NGS assays, and prevalent literature. 

Beth has worked at Mayo Clinic since 2007 and completed her Masterâ€™s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular biology in 2015 with foci on cancer biology and bioinformatics at the Mayo Graduate School.  Her interpretation worked has led to platform presentations at the Cancer Genomics Consortium annual meeting.  Additionally, Beth has developed publically available [knowledgebase tutorials](https://cancervariants.org/resources/), a publicly-available [Cancer Variant Knowledgebases Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dBh1Qkp8os), and has given an introduction to genomic knowledgebase workshop at the Association of Genetic Technologists/American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science joint annual meeting. Beth is an active member of the Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC), an affiliate member of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), and has contributed to the ClinGen Somatic Working Group in addition to her involvement in the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC).

Beth has co-authored over 25 peer-reviewed manuscripts, and is frequently involved in clinical and translational research in the Mayo Clinic Genomics Laboratory within the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. These publications focus mainly on cytogenetics, NGS, bioinformatics, and various other laboratory genetic techniques.
