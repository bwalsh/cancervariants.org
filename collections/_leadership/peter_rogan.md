I have more than 30 years of academic and industry experience creating methods for interpretation chromosomal, mutation, and gene signatures of disease and applying these methods, especially within the past 5 years, to oncology patients.  My work has been broadly disseminated through highly accessed publications and is  implimented as publically available genome bioinformatic software applications.  As an inventor and serial  entrepreneur, I have distributed and sold software and consumable products  based on algorithms for interpreting variation in genomic sequences, cytogenomic analysis and radiation biodosimetry.
